### This is where you input all the YouTube channels you want to have videos downloaded from.
### It is recommended to use URLs that look like: '/channel/UC0vaVaSyV14uvJ4hEZDOl0Q', as the other ones might get changed. You get this URL by going to a video and clicking on the uploader.
### A recent change makes it that you have to add '/videos' to the end of channel URLs, otherwise you will download "related" channels and other things.
### This *should* automatically be added but I still recommend you add it to the end of all URLs.
