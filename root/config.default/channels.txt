### This is where you input all the YouTube channels you want to have videos downloaded from.
### It is recommended to use the ID-based URLs, they look like: '/channel/UC0vaVaSyV14uvJ4hEZDOl0Q', as the other ones might get changed.
### You find the ID-based URL by going to a video and clicking on the uploader.
### A recent change makes it that all channel URLs must end with '/videos', otherwise you will download "related" channels and other things.
### This should be added automatically but I still recommend you add it to the end of all channel URLs.
